            Creativity is characterised by the ability to perceive the world in
            new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between
            seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. Through
            technology there is so many more possibilities than we had ever
            imagined, making dreams into reality and striving to create
            intuitive and imaginative design to introduce new and exciting
            technologies to the market and into our daily lives.</strong

            >Everyone should be able to access and enjoy the web. Accessibility
            is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as
            possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with
            disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also
            benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those
            with slow network connections. Regardless of what ones situation is
            the web should be able to benefit them in some way, the closer we
            are to a free acessible web the more we are interconnected which is
            ultimately the goal of the internet, the sharing of information and
            ideas.

          Building websites that maximize productivity increase output,
           and measure variables accurately and effectivly to drive most of the 
           basic mechanics that we many times take for granted. Minimizing 
           bandwidth, increasing broadband connectivity and utilizing new technologies
           are just a few ways we can optimize productivity. Looking towards the
           future building websites that utilize these tools is something essential
            moving forward in the tech industry and further. </strong></p>
