      Hi! My name is Sean Hussey. I just moved to Austin, Texas from Orlando,
      Florida. I'm currently a student learning computer programming at The
      University of Texas Bootcamp program. I enjoy playing and listening to
      music, hiking, fishing, the outdoors, being out on the water, traveling
      and hanging out with friends and family. My goal in this program is to
      aquire the skills to be able to get a career in software development and
      also be able to get into real-estate further down the line.
