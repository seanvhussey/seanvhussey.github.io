In this assignment we were challenged to make a portfolio website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
I utilized my knowledge of the bootstrap grid format as well as flex box.
Using these skills i was able to format the website properly to display different elements.
I was also able to format a Navbar to direct the user to different pages on my website.
I used inline styling as well as bootstrap styling to make the website look presentable and accessible.
Additionally, i used my knowledge of media queries to present ledgible and structured content at different screen sizes.
